  <p class="introduction">I'm an Optometrist and I like the Medical feild, but after working for Foxconn, I realized how much I like 
    computers and how much I like to trouble shoot and fix big servers. Our main customer is Cisco, 
    and we follow their instructions.Anyways to make a long story short, I saw one of my co-worker is trying to solve a 
    Javascript problem on Edabit, I sat down with him, and I can letterly say that I fall in love with Javascript. I know 
    website Developer is not all about Js, but it makes up a huge portion of it.</p>
